          <section class="content"><p>Alarm rang at 7:30.
Went back to sleep.<span class="more"></span>
Alex got up to get coffee, came back after what felt like 30 seconds (but was really 20 minutes) to drag me out of bed military-style.
Got ready in 5 minutes, grabbed a snack, and off to the&nbsp;gym.</p>
<p>Apparently the member of staff we spoke to the previous day gave us wrong prices for the day pass, and the actual price was supposed to be higher. We got away with paying the lower price, but I hope we didn’t get her into trouble.
For some reason they had French <span class="caps">TV</span> in the gym so I did squats to the sweet sound of Diam’s music – let’s keep this a one-time&nbsp;thing. </p>
<p>After a well deserved breakfast and shower, we drove up to Sintra to visit the Pena National Palace. [history/description]
I was having a hard time reconciling the <span class="caps">XXX</span> of its construction (?) and historical importance, with the fact that it looks just like a fake plastic-y castle from Disneyworld built in the 90s. Seriously, I was singing It’s a Small World the whole&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>As part of the visit, we also walked around the gigantic park around the castle, and that was some serious exercise. Not only is everything far from everything else, but the whole estate is built on freaking hills. After we climbed up the highest viewpoint of the park, we could see the castle literally on another hill more than 1km away. Who thought it would be a good idea to design and deliver this castle to a member of nobility, and be like “there you go, now you can be trapped in your castle forever because let’s be honest, you will never be bothered to walk past the frontsteps”? Needless to say, that was the most hardcore leg day in my entire life.
Despite all the efforts, the visit was actually amazing. The park being so huge, we were often away from other tourists and able to enjoy quiet, nature, and the magnificent view of the Sintra-Cascais Natural Park&nbsp;around.</p>
<p>If there was one place that we were expecting to be flat, it sure was Lisbon. Well nope, just as hill-y as the rest of Portugal.
Our first endeavour was to find food though, and one of the recommended places was <span class="caps">XXX</span>. They’re a tiny place with 2 employees and nowhere to sit, and it smells heavenly. We got a grilled meat mix to takeaway and ate in the car like savages – sloppy, but so damn good.
As usual, we struggled to find a parking spot but finally made it to the airbnb flat. We vaguely thought about going out and experience the Lisbon nightlife, but laziness got the best of us and we opted for an early night&nbsp;instead.</p>
