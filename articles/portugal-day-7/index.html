          <section class="content"><p>I was hoping to spend 2 full days in Lisbon but unfortunately our next airbnb host needed us to arrive early, so we only had time for a couple more touristy stuff in the morning.

<p>While having lunch, we realised we underestimated the time it would take to get to our next location. Once again, we had to leave precipitously and rush.
Alex was speeding like a madman on the motorway, until I noticed our tank was almost empty. The next gas station being a whole 30km away, we had to stick to 50km/h to use as little fuel as possible – not only was all the time we saved by speeding lost, but we really thought we would end up stranded on the motorway, not make it in time, and have nowhere to sleep. Fortunately, we barely just made it in time to the gas station.&nbsp;Phew.</p>
<p>We met the host near Nossa Senhora de Machede’s church, and she led us through dirt roads to her house in the countryside.There we were greeted by her 4 dogs and even more cats. One of the dogs, Benny, was a jumpy teenager always eager to play and get cuddles. Every time another pet got some attention, he would barge in and steal it back. Good thing teenage dogs don’t have access to facebook or instagram. The house had an immense backyard and was surrounded by wild grass and bushes, perfect for a little walk with the&nbsp;pets.</p>
<p>Nossa Senhora de Machede is such a small village that it only has 3 restaurant/bar/pubs, all next to each other. We picked one at random to try some very famous Black Porc (Iberian Porc), a local specialty. [more info on this]. And it did not disappoint, the whole meal was just delicious. People in general are very friendly in Portugal, but the owner of the restaurant just seemed extraordinarily nice and caring. At the end of the meal we were prepared to tip loads but instead he made us pay even less, despite our protestations, so I left feeling all&nbsp;guilty.</p>
<p>Being in the countryside means no light pollution, which means I got to see stars for the first time in months, possibly years. On our way back to the house, we stopped the car and did some star gazing, it was wonderful. The only negative point was, and I can’t believe I’m about to say this, that the full moon was too bright and hiding most of the stars.&nbsp;#thirdworldproblem</p>
