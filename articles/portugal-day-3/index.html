          <section class="content"><p>As soon as the alarm went off, I kicked Alex out of bed. The plan was for him to go back to the restaurant to get breakfast, while I showered and got ready <span class="more"></span>– I decided to skip breakfast, not wanting to get car sick during the mountain drive. I sleepily stepped into the shower and, surprise surprise, realised I’d bought hair conditioner instead of shampoo (classic me). “Meh, that will do for the rest of the trip I&nbsp;guess”.</p>
<p>When we were finally ready to go, we followed the <span class="caps">GPS</span> for about 7km to the Poço do Inferno waterfall. It was quite impressive but the name, literally meaning “Pit of Hell”, set significantly higher expectations. After a short walk on the wooden stairs and walkway, we got to the foot of the waterfall. The water was crystal clear, but freezing. Alex decided to go for a swim in his trunks (“erm, you know you have a wetsuit in the car right? That you bought especially for this&nbsp;trip?”).</p>
<p>Alex to tell about his swimming (near death)&nbsp;experience</p>
<p>On our way to the next destination, we drove up the mountain to 1700m of altitude. At some point it got so foggy that we could barely see a few meters in front of us, and cars seemed to be emerging from nowhere.
We got to the <span class="caps">XXX</span> dam, hoping to see Covao dos Conchos [more description]. We walked around the dam for a bit, and hike a little further back. When it started hailing, we made our way back to the shop near the parking lot. The owner was selling all sorts of artisanal products: cheese, sausage, gloves, hats, furs, souvenirs. We bought some sausage and a pair of gloves for Alex, while playing with 2 little&nbsp;puppies.</p>
<p>To our disappointment, the shop owner told us that Covao dos Conchos was a 2 hours hike away, and that it would be night by the time we made it back. No thanks. 
Instead, we stuck to the plan and went to visit&nbsp;Coimbra. </p>
<p>Coimbra was the political centre of Portugal for a long period, and was actually the Kingdom of Portugal’s capital from 1131 to 1255, before transitioning to a major cultural centre. The University, established in 1290, is the oldest academic institution in the Portuguese-speaking world. 
We parked next to the cathedral and were planning to visit it, but the entrance was paid so we lol-nope’ed around and left. We walked through the old centre, down to the pedestrian street rua Ferreira Borges. There we found a bakery, or pastelaria, with yummy-looking treats, and got a few to try. In the time it took for us to order and pay, it had started raining pretty violently so we decided to eat inside and have some tea as well. We left when it got a bit better but we still got wet on our way to the&nbsp;car.</p>
<p>Our next airbnb reservation was in Caldas da Rainha, and it was a freaking palace. Large kitchen, even larger living room, tiled walls, wooden staircase and floor, 3 guest bedrooms…and the guest bathroom {photo + caption “yes I had a bath”}. 
We went for dinner at a place recommended by the hosts, Maratona. They served massive burgers and fries for about €6/pp. We also ordered freshly pressed fruit juice and had a strawberry-parmesan cake for dessert. Me&nbsp;happy.</p>
