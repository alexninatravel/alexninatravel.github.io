          <section class="content"><p>It turned out that the parking spot we found the previous day was only free until 9am so Alex had to go find another spot.<span class="more"></span>
In the meantime, I decided to cook breakfast with leftovers from previous days (and the ton of spinach we bought at the fruit market). The kitchen was well equipped and had all my favourite ingredients: olive oil, provence herbs, nutmeg. I went&nbsp;craaazy.</p>
<p>We basically spend the whole day doing standard touristy things in Lisbon: Rossio place, Commerce square (??), riverside, Alfama (the oldest part of the city). In Alfama we stopped for coffee in a cozy little place, and ended up staying for one and a half hours (they had fast&nbsp;wifi).</p>
<p>On our way back, we went back to the market on <span class="caps">XXX</span> to buy biscuits, jams and charcuterie, and some food for dinner. That night was the only single time we stayed home and cooked for dinner. For dessert we got 2 traditional pastries: the rock and the torch. The rock wasn’t nearly as good as I was hoping, but the torch was blatantly disgusting – it was basically 100%&nbsp;sugar.</p>
