          <section class="content"><p>After a huge breakfast (included with the room), we set off to the beach. The weather was really nice again, and I couldn’t wait to go swim.<span class="more"></span>Our first stop 2 hours away was at Sagres, very famous for surfing. The sea was quite wavy and we contemplated renting surf boards but decided to keep driving and find a nice place to go snorkeling. Back in the suffocatingly hot car for a little while, and we got to <span class="caps">XXX</span>. After a short hike down some stairs, we got an amazing view, but still no swimmable beach. I went from happy and excited to annoyed real&nbsp;quick.</p>
<p>Finally, the next location was perfect for swimming. We quickly got into our wetsuits and dived into the water. Even through the wetsuit, I was feeling really cold and my hands were freezing. Still, just being in the ocean was supremely cool. Alex went snorkeling a bit further away and I just stayed on the beach, trying to warm up under the 4pm sun and drying my clothes <span class="caps">BBQ</span> style on the stair handle (wetsuit, obviously, but my trousers and shoes were also drenched from walking on the beach and getting caught by a&nbsp;wave).</p>
<p>After a nice shower at the guesthouse, we went for dinner at <span class="caps">XXX</span>. It was a small restaurant on the seaside, owned and run by a jovial Londoner. The dog, Alfie, was one of the nicest people I’ve ever met. And his food was delicious.

No photo of the main dish because it looked and smelled so tasty we couldn’t wait to dig into it. It was a mix of beef steak, pork ribs and chicken breast on the&nbsp;grill.</p>
<p>As if one dessert wasn’t enough, Alex insisted on going for ice cream on our way back to the hotel, which promptly fell to the&nbsp;floor.</p>
