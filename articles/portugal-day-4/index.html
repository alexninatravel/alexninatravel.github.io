          <section class="content"><p>One of Caldas de Rainha’s famous attractions is the fruit market, the only market to be open daily in all of Portugal.<span class="more"></span> The market even gives its name to the square where it’s held, Praca de Fruta, and is well known to have high quality fresh products. In about 20 minutes of going around it, we bought almost 2kg of fruits and vegetables, which lasted us until the end of the trip (and we even brought some apples back).
That day we had lunch in the best ranked restaurant in the town: <span class="caps">XX</span>. Not only was the food excellent, but the service was very friendly (and they had wifi!). Alex was talking about getting a haircut that same day, and very conveniently we found a hairdresser / tattoo artist right next to the restaurant. Unfortunately they were just closing as we came in. Side note: the trending hairstyle in Portugal is shaved/short sides with a gelled puff on top (i.e. what I call “the footballer’s haircut”) – we saw variations placarde across every single hairdresser’s&nbsp;window.</p>
<p>Next destination:&nbsp;Peniche.</p>
<p>Peniche intro
We went to visit the famous Fort, but not before having a nap on the rocks nearby (because priorities). Info/description on the&nbsp;Fort. </p>
<p>Since we still had a couple of hours before checking in, we had a walk on the cliffs at Cabo Carvoeiro.

<p>For dinner we had a gigantic “seafood platter for 2” that could have easily fed 4 people. Needless to say we couldn’t finish it, although we did eat most of&nbsp;it. </p>
<p>That night was the worst night ever because everything smelled damp and the bed was squeaky. Or, maybe it was because on the way home from dinner we drove past a gym, drove back there, parked the car, inquired about opening times and prices, and beaming Alex said “nice, we can wake up at 7 tomorrow and go train&nbsp;you”. </p>
