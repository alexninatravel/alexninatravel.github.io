          <section class="content"><p>Breakfast that morning was a unique experience: eating with one hand while using the other one to fend off all the hungry pets simultaneously coming for our food. We mostly managed to keep them away, though we did lose a piece of cheese and bread to a skillful cat while we were busy clearing up the table. <span class="more"></span></p>
<p>We had a hard time leaving the house, it was such a lovely place with fun companions. Eventually we went for a quick tour of Evora’s Roman ruins and church [more history], and had a look around the artisans’ shops on <span class="caps">XXX</span> street. On the same street, we went for lunch in Momentos. The menu sounded quite attractive, but the waiter completely won Alex over when he said “we serve our dishes with locally-sourced, organic vegetables – not the usual pasta, fries or&nbsp;rice”.</p>
<p>Time to go to the beach! We drove down along the coast towards <span class="caps">XXX</span>. We had been lucky with the weather that far, but on the first day that we went to the beach, it was cold and rainy. It was still a nice experience, we got an amazing view of the waves from a secluded beach near XXX. When it was time to leave, our wheels got stuck in the sand and we couldn’t start the car. Thankfully, a group of young locals happened to be in the area and helped us push the car.
We drove down a bit further and Alex decided to go for a swim (again, without his wetsuit) and I waited and waited with my camera ready for XXX minutes to catch the moment when he would finally go in. He&nbsp;didn’t.</p>
<p>We stayed in Villa Nova de Milfontes that night. The hosts had an internal courtyard with a main building, and 3 other guest apartments. We were in one of them, which had 2 bedrooms, a kitchen / living-room area, bathroom, and even a washing machine.
I was already in bed and half asleep when Alex told me the kitchen smelled like gas so he turned the heater off and opened the door to bring some air in. (not sure if it’s worth telling. If so, elaborate&nbsp;more)</p>
