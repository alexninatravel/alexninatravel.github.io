          <section class="content"><p>For our first breakfast in Portugal, our decision-making process was the following: go to the nearest place that serves coffee and eat whatever they have. Boom, sorted.
After a short drive, we arrived in Viseu to see more azulejos around the main square..

<p>We also stopped at Spar to get some food supplies, and because I forgot to pack shampoo. We ended up getting 5L of water (that we carried around until the very last day of the trip and didn’t finish) and loads of&nbsp;biscuits.</p>
<p>Our next destination was Manteigas, a small village in the Serra da Estrela Natural Park. We were a bit confused about where to go, since the airbnb website and google maps gave us 2 different locations. We decided to go with airbnb’s and drove around the natural park to get to a tiny village named near Covilha. All of the inhabitants were shooting us funny looks, as if we were the first visitors in months - which was most probably the case. We found the address and parked in front of the house and waited for the host to arrive. Of course, it was the wrong place. O Google, prithee forgive us f’r doubting thee. More emergency-driving to the actual place 20 minutes away, because guess what, the host had to leave for work&nbsp;soon.</p>

<p>The house was located on the mountainside and offered a magnificent of the&nbsp;park.</p>
<p>After having a nice dinner at Restaurante Santa Luzia, we went to bed early in preparation for some hiking the next&nbsp;day.</p>
